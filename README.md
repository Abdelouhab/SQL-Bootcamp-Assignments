# SQL Bootcamp Assignments

This repository contains my assignments and projects from **The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero** course. The course provided comprehensive training in SQL (Structured Query Language), covering essential concepts and techniques for working with relational databases.

## Assessments

### Assessment 1: Introduction to SQL
**Description:** This assignment focuses on basic SQL queries, such as selecting data from tables, filtering rows, and sorting results. It covers the foundational concepts of SQL syntax and query execution.

**Files:**
- `ASSESSMENT 1.pdf`: SQL script containing the queries for Assignment 1.
- `SOLUTIONS ASSESSMENT 1.pdf`: Instructions and explanations for running the queries and understanding the results.

### Assessment 2: Data Manipulation and Aggregation
**Description:** In this assignment, we dive deeper into data manipulation using SQL. It covers inserting, updating, and deleting records in a database. Additionally, it explores aggregate functions to calculate summary statistics.

**Files:**
- `ASSESSMENT 2.pdf`: SQL script with data manipulation and aggregation queries.
- `SOLUTIONS ASSESSMENT 2.pdf`: Instructions and explanations for running the queries and interpreting the results.

### Assessment 3: Advanced SQL Concepts
**Description:** This assignment delves into advanced SQL concepts, including joins, subqueries, and views. It demonstrates how to combine data from multiple tables, perform complex queries, and create reusable views.

**Files:**
- `ASSESSMENT 3.pdf`: SQL script containing advanced SQL queries and view definitions.
- `SOLUTIONS ASSESSMENT 3.pdf`: Instructions and explanations for executing the queries and utilizing the views.

## Getting Started

To run the SQL queries and interact with the assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/Abdelouhab/SQL-Bootcamp-Assignments.git

2. Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL (the one I used).

3. Upload the Database `dvdrental.tar` and `exercises.tar` into PostgreSQL.
  
4. Execute the SQL scripts for each assignment using a database client or command-line interface.

5. Refer to the respective README files within each assignment folder for specific instructions and insights on the queries and results.
